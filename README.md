# Project Description:
We will be creating a game heavily inspired by that of “Kingdom of Loathing” but with the setting being that of a person from stuyvesant. Players take the role of an average 17 year old attempting to survive the numerous exam/boss fights of the teachers. Each location that they visit in each of the 3 progression stages contain minigames that reward items or stat increases but making a bad decision can cause permanent debuffs. Survive the school day by collecting gear, achievements, and do anything necessary to defeat the ridiculous bosses/teachers in this turn based RPG.

## Launch Codes

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that **Git**, **Python** and **Ubuntu** are installed on your machine. It is recommended that you use a virtual machine when running this project to avoid any possible conflicts. For help, refer to the following documentation:
   1. Installing Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
   2. Installing Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   3. Installing Ubuntu onto your droplet: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-ubuntu-server-on-a-digitalocean-droplet

### How to run


1. Create Python virtual environment:

```
python3 -m PATH/TO/venv_name
```

2. Activate virtual environment

   - Linux: `. PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `. .\PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - Windows (Command Prompt): `>PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS: `source PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`

   *Notes*

   - If successful, command line will display name of virtual environment: `(venv_name) `

   - Type `deactivate` in the terminal to close a virtual environment

3. Navigate to project app directory

```
cd PATH/TO/whileTrueCode-/app/
```

4. Run App

```
 python3 __init__.py
```
5. Open the link that appears in the terminal to be brought to the website
    - You can visit the link via several methods:
        - Control + Clicking on the link
        - Typing/Pasting http://127.0.0.1:5000 in any browser
